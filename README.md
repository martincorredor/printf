# printf
This project contains a mini version of the * printf * function
that we can find in the library <stdio.h>,
if we are using the *C programming language.*
The * printf * function basically allows us to print any argument
given to standard or terminal output. This means that we can print
any combination of strings, integers, and other different data types.
